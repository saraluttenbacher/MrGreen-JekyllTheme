I am a recent graduate from Simmons University with a B.S. in Data Science and Analytics. I was drawn to data science because it seemed like a perfect marriage of analytical and intuitive, technical and practical. I enjoy going beyond simple calculations to truly understand the data and what it means in context. There’s nothing I enjoy more than a good puzzle to solve. I excel at working independently but will not hesitate to throw myself whole-heartedly into a good group project. I have worked with both R and python for several years. I also have experience in both SQL and NoSQL, and am familiar with MySQL, MongoDB, and Cassandra. I am searching for a mutually beneficial position where I can grow professionally while helping my employer reach their goals. 

Outside of work, I’ve always got some sort of project going - crocheting, sewing, painting, and all other sorts of DIY. There’s nothing quite so satisfying as looking at something you’ve created with your own two hands, especially after you’ve gone through the whole process of trying things out, researching techniques and methods, adapting your strategies, and trying again. I also enjoy playing video games in my free time. Mostly I play casual RPGs like BOTW, ACNH, and Stardew Valley, but occasionally I enjoy more intense games like Dead Rising and Resident Evil. Other than that, I’m usually playing with my dog and his menagerie of stuffed animals.
